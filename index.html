            <h3>Sri Sumangala Collage - Wariyapola</h3>
            <p>
              I began my student life in 2010 at Sri Sumangala National College,
              Wariyapola, where I studied for 13 years from Grade 1 to A/Ls.
              Despite qualifying for other opportunities, I proudly remained at
              the same school throughout. I passed the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam,
              and later achieved outstanding results in the GCE O/Ls with 8 A
              passes and 1 B. I pursued my A/Ls in the Physical Science stream
              and sat for the GCE A/L exam in 2023 (2024), earning a B in
              Chemistry, and C passes in both Combined Mathematics and Physics.
              With these results, I was selected for the BSc (Hons) in Computer
              Science and Technology at Uva Wellassa University, Sri Lanka.

              While waiting for university admission, I enrolled in the NVQ

              successfully completed the course and obtained the official

              Meanwhile, I was fortunate to receive an opportunity to join
              People's Bank Sri Lanka as a Banking Trainee on a 6-month
              contract. It was a valuable experience that gave me insight into
              how an organization operates and taught me the importance of
              teamwork and unity in a professional environment.
